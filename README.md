# Vim Reference Guide

**Vim Reference Guide** is intended as a concise learning resource for beginner to intermediate level Vim users. It has more in common with cheatsheets than a typical text book. Topics like Regular Expressions and Macros have more detailed explanations and examples due to their complexity.

See [Version_changes.md](./Version_changes.md) to keep track of changes made to the book.
